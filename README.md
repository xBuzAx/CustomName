## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for looking here :)



I present my next project of a sample website based on Bootstrap library (working locally on a computer) using HTML, SCSS, JS languages. I also used Parcel(https://en.parceljs.org/getting_started.html) code bundler for the project.

You can open the project directly from the dist/index.html folder.

If you want to see all the code content before build and open on localhost, then follow these steps:
npm i
npm run dev

This is my first project which i focused on JS.
